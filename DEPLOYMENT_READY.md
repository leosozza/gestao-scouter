## 🎯 Expected Results

After deployment, you should see:

### In Browser Console
```
GoogleSheetsService: 64 scouters processados da aba dedicada
GoogleSheetsService: Scouters ativos: 64
scoutersRepo: Using data from Scouters tab (64 scouters found)
scoutersRepo: Enriched 64 scouters (64 active, 0 inactive)
```

### In Scouters Page UI
- **Total Scouters card:** Shows 64
- **Ativos na equipe:** Shows 64 (or actual active count)
- **Scouter table:** Lists all 64 scouters with correct data
- **Tier/Status:** Correctly displayed from sheet

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you see 0 scouters:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify GID 1351167110 is correct
3. Check column names in your sheet
4. Refer to documentation

### If using fallback:
Console will show: "Scouters tab empty, falling back..."
- This means the Scouters tab fetch failed
- System will derive scouters from fichas (old behavior)
- Check network tab for CORS or 404 errors

### If names don't match:
- Ensure scouter names are identical in both tabs
- Names are normalized (accents removed, spaces trimmed)
- Check first 3 scouters in console logs for matching

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. The code automatically falls back to old behavior
2. No data loss occurs
3. Simply revert the commits if needed:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD~5..HEAD
   ```

## 📊 Performance Impact

- **Bundle Size:** +0.68 kB (< 1% increase)
- **Runtime:** +200-500ms on page load (one-time, cached)
- **Memory:** Negligible
- **User Experience:** No visible impact
